# smash-logger

Side-project to log the results of my Smash Ultimate games and training sessions.
Please do not use this project for anything as I have no clue about Frontend Development and generally don't know what I'm doing.

I'm using VueJS 3 (scaffolded the project with vue-create), and will code it as an SPA.
My aim is to host it with GitHub Pages, and use this app from my phone when I play.

npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production
